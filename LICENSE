### 9. Git and GitHub

1. Initialize a git repository:
    ```sh
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub and push:
    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-api.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```

This setup provides a fully functional RESTful API for a bookstore with user authentication, CRUD operations, and Swagger documentation.
